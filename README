Pylayers is an elegant, unified and comprehensive educational system that
teaches the fundamentals of software compilation, interpretation and execution
using Python. It is designed for students, teachers and ambitious computer
programmers. Compilation converts source code to intermediate code, then to
assembly code, and finally, to machine code. These compilation stages can be
pictorially represented by layers:

          _________________________________________
         |               source code               |
         |_________________________________________|
         |            intermediate code            |
         |_________________________________________|
         |              assembly code              |
         |_________________________________________|
         |              machine code               |
         |_________________________________________|


Computers only execute machine code. Interpreters can execute ("interpret")
intermediate code. Pylayers teaches about these and numerous other related
topics, all with working Python code, including: intermediate code generators,
assembly code generators, machine code generators (assemblers), grammars,
tokenizers, tokens, parsers, productions, abstract syntax trees, registers,
instruction sets and more. An extensively documented compiler, interpreter and
computer, all implemented in Python, are provided.

I hope you find Pylayers instructive. I the author, Dr. Christian Seberino,
